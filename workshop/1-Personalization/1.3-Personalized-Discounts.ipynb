    "The structure of this workshop\n",

    " personalized recommendations on the Retail Demo Store homepage,\n",
    " and personalized ranking of items on the featured product page,\n",
    " to give our users targeted recommendations based on their activity.\n",
    " However, we add a \"discount\" context to interactions using Personalize's\n",
    "  \"contextual metadata\"\n",
    "facility, to account for whether a product is\n",
    "being offered discounted or not. Then, we can make use of the personalized ranking\n",
    "campaign with the context set to \"discounted\" to choose the best product to offer\n",
    "discounted.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original workshop also provides a script for simulating interactions between users and products,\n",
    "so that we can train Personalize to give us realistic recommendations.\n",
    "In this workshop we also add some logic to the interactions simulation script to retain a more realistic balance in data\n",

    "Amazon Personalize provides predefined recipes, based on common use cases, for training models. A recipe is a machine learning algorithm that you use with settings, or hyperparameters, and the data you provide to train an Amazon Personalize model. The data you provide to train a model are organized into separate datasets by the type of data being provided. A collection of datasets are organized into a dataset group. The three dataset types supported by Personalize are items, users, and interactions. Depending on the recipe type you choose, a different combination of dataset types are required. For all recipe types, an interactions dataset is required. Interactions represent how users interact with items. For example, viewing a product, watching a video, listening to a recording, or reading an article. For this workshop, we will be using a recipe that supports all three dataset types.\n",

We will use this data to train three models, or solutions, in the Amazon Personalize service which will be used to serve product recommendations, related items,  and to rerank product lists for our users. The User and Product data can be accessed from the Retail Demo Store's [Users](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/tree/master/src/users) and [Products](https://github.com/aws-samples/retail-demo-store/tree/master/src/products) microservices, respectively.
